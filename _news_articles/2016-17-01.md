For time and location visit [Fun With Technology](http://bit.ly/1n5dH0D).

The topic for this meetup is surrounding PowerShell. The idea behind this discussion is to help developers understand the tools of systems automation and provide infrastructure engineers a bit more depth  on the language. Initially we will discuss the PowerShell ecosystem and the current state of the technology. 

Thanks to Matt Faulkner for providing the venue.
