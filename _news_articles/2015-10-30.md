For time and location visit [Fun With Technology](http://bit.ly/fwt-meetup).

The "Let's Get Functional" topic series is geared towards learning and sharing experiences in making the functional programming transition (or at least adding and/or growing the skill set), from a more traditional Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) model.

Functional programming has found itself in many new/emerging technologies and OOP developers struggle in making the transition. Sophcon is no different and we want to start the conversation about what we've learned, in hopes that this will help others. And in the process, do a bit of learning ourselves, from others and their feedback/experiences.
