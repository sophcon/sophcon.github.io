The topic for this meetup is a continuation from our "Lets Get Functional" series. The "Let's Get Functional" topic series is geared towards learning and sharing experiences in making the functional programming transition (or at least adding and/or growing the skill set), from a more traditional Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) model. In this iteration we will dig a little bit deeper into the F# Type System and show how it can reduce complexity.
