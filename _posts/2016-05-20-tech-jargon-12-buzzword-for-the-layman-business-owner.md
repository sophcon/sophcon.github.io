Being in the tech industry for the better half of a decade now, working as an IT staff and being a part of a startup providing technical consulting to business, I find that in most situations where I had to communicate with nontechnical clients, it can be challenging. This is due to a misconception on my part that what I've taken to be common knowledge, in regards to technology, is not always the case. I have found in many occasions where I spent a good portion of the meeting explaining what **Responsive Design**, **Scrum Software Development** or **SaaS** is and end with an overly long meeting just to ensure that we cover the agenda items. I have also been in meetings where the client is tech savvy enough to follow along. These types of conversation ends being more productive and I also walk away from them with a clearer understanding of what the requirements are.

With the ever growing demand from business to incorporate technology to grow or improve their business, from having an online store or automating a business process, the Business Owner must now speak and understand some level of the tech language in order to communicate effectively with in house IT staff or IT consultants. Not to say that as a IT personnel one should not be open to providing clarity where there is questions, but by understanding some of the higher level and/or common tech jargon, this will help Business Owners contribute to the solution and understand what they are getting into.

I've compiled a list of *12 Buzzwords/Phrase/Acronyms* that will help the Layman Business Owner understand and communicate with their technical staff.

1.  **Agile Software Development**

    Describes a set of principles for software development where the development and functional teams work closely together. Requirements and solutions are not static but evolve through shorter iteration where a functional software is available. This type of software development style promotes **"adaptive planning", "evolutionary development", "early delivery", "continuous improvement"**, and **"encourages rapid and flexible response to change"**. [for more info](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agile_software_development)

2.  **Scrum Software Development**

    Is the framework to manage product development using agile software development (see above) principles. The framework defines 'a flexible, holistic product development strategy where a development team works as a unit to reach a common goal' and encourages physical co-locations or a close online collaboration of all team members. The framework also encourages short daily face-to-face communication sessions with all the team members of the project. [for more info](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrum_(software_development))

3.  **Responsive Web Design or Mobile First Design**

    Describes a web design approach where the web site is created to provide the optimal viewing and interaction experience regardless of the device it is being presented on (from desktop computer monitors to tablets to mobile phone). [for more info](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Responsive_web_design)

4.  **Cloud Services**

    Cloud Services are services offered from cloud computing (shared pool of computing resources) provider. These services can be grouped into three offerings:

    1. **SaaS (Software as a Service)**

	     *"Software as a Service (SaaS) is a software licensing and delivery model in which software is licensed on a subscription basis and is centrally hosted. It is sometimes referred to as 'on-demand software'. SaaS is typically accessed by users using a thin client via a web browser"* - [for more info](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_computing#Software_as_a_service_.28SaaS.29)

	  2. **PaaS (Platform as a Service)**

	     *"Platform as a service (PaaS) is a category of cloud computing services that provides a platform allowing customers to develop, run, and manage applications without the complexity of building and maintaining the infrastructure typically associated with developing and launching an app. PaaS can be delivered in two ways: as a public cloud service from a provider, where the consumer controls software deployment with minimal configuration options, and the provider provides the networks, servers, storage, OS, 'middleware' (i.e.; java runtime, .net runtime, integration, etc.), database and other services to host the consumer's application; or as a private service (software or appliance)inside the firewall, or as software deployed on a public infrastructure as a service."* - [for more info](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platform_as_a_service)

	  3. **IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service)**

	     *"IaaS refers to online services that abstract the user from the details of infrastructure like physical computing resources, location, data partitioning, scaling, security, backup etc."* - [for more info](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_computing#Infrastructure_as_a_service_.28IaaS.29)

5. **API (Application Programming Interface)**

    *"An API expresses a software component in terms of its operations, inputs, outputs, and underlying types, defining functionalities that are independent of their respective implementations, which allows definitions and implementations to vary without compromising the interface. A good API makes it easier to develop a program by providing all the building blocks, which are then put together by the programmer."* - [for more info](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_programming_interface)

6. **IoT (Internet of Things)**

    Is a network of "things" (devices, vehicles, buildings, etc…) that have within electronics, software, sensors, and network connectivity that enables them to exchange data. [for more info]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_of_Things)

7.  **Push technology**

    Describes a style of Internet based communications where data is pushed to the client device from a publisher or central server. This type of technology is common on mobile devices allowing application publishers to push notifications to their clients. There are applications/services that mimic pull style of communication by requesting for data on a set interval (ex: some email clients) [for more info](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Push_technology)

8.  **Scope Creep**

    Describes the situation where the original project goals are expanded while the it is in progress. This, if allowed, will extend the completion date of the project or even fail before it is finished. If the project somehow is completed, the resulting deliverables look nothing like what was envisioned. [for more info](https://www.techopedia.com/definition/24779/scope-creep)

9.  **Containers (Operating-system-level virtualization)**

    Is a IT term that describes the technology used to isolate and contain a virtual instance of an operating system which upon access looks and functions like a real server. [for more info](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operating-system-level_virtualization)

10. **Open Source**

    Is software source code that is made available with a license in which the copyright holder provides the rights to study, change, and distribute the software to anyone or for any purpose. [for more info](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_software)

11. **Business Intelligence (BI)**

    Can be define as 'a set of techniques and tools for the acquisition and transformation of raw data into meaningful and useful information for business analysis purposes'. BI tools help process large amount of data to help identify and develop/create new strategic business opportunities. [for more info](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_intelligence)

12. **Virtualization**

    Means to create a virtual version of a device or resource (ex: server, storage device, network, operating system…etc). [for more info](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtualization)
