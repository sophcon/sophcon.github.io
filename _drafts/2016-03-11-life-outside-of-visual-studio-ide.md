## My Story (an IDE tale)
My name is Yer Yang, I've been developing on the Microsoft stack for a little over a decade now and have always had the luxury of working with Microsoft Visual Studio (VS) IDE. Started out on [VS 6.0](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Visual_Studio#Visual_Studio_6.0_.281998.29) programing small VB 6 thick client applications then moving on to later release of VS creating web base applications. It wasn't until a non Microsoft tech conferences that I realized what non Microsoft developers dev environment was like. There were so many options as far as what IDE to use and to get a development machine up and running took a little more effort then just installing the IDE. I will now tell my story of my transition from being strictly Microsoft developer working with Visual Studio IDE and moving into open source using the vast number of editors available.

As a .NET developer at the early stages of my career I thought Microsoft was the place to be as a developer because of how easy they made everything. To setup a development machine, I had one source to go to that had everything I needed from a trusted source for the installation files and all the resources I needed to helping me trouble shoot any issues I may have along the way. The setup itself took care of everything from installing the libraries I needed, setting up a development environment complete with push button build, run and even host the application on my local system and to boot it installed an IDE with built in templates that allowed me to get a fully functional application off the ground with a few clicks for both thick and thin clients.

It wasn't until I joined an organization which had a mix of development teams with different language developers that I started to actually gain an appreciation for other technologies. It all started when I wanted to test the waters and start to do some Java development. I started as I would have done with install a Microsoft product, went straight to [Java.com](www.java.com/en) and clicked download. After reading through a wide range of documentation and information regarding the download, I realize that what was there was not the development toolkit. After some Googling came across [Paris Apostolopoulos](http://javapapo.blogspot.com/2013/03/setup-your-java-development-environment.html) blog post that had step by step instructions to getting a development machine setup for Java development. I finally got my machine ready to start developing, or so I thought. I ran through a few "Hello World" tutorials and found the syntax was very similar to C#. I then went to open some code developed by the Java team just to see if I could get an application up and running on my local machine. That is where it all went wrong, I had a newer version of the JDK installed and the application would not run because it was dependent on a latter build. I finally got my system setup and the application running and was really looking forward to start developing small Java applications.

With getting At first it was a painful experience because there was not one source I could rely on to get all my information I needed to get my development machine ready to just start coding.
